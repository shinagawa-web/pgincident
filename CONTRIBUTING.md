## Dev environment

```bash
make dev-up   # starts Postgres 16 with pgincident_dev / pg_monitor
make run      # builds and launches the TUI
make dev-down # stop and remove the container
```

## Simulating incident scenarios

Each scenario requires separate terminal windows.

**Long-running query (> 5s)**

Terminal 1 — seed a 30-second sleep:
```bash
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -c "SELECT pg_sleep(30);"
```
Terminal 2 — run the TUI and verify section 1 shows the query:
```bash
make run
```

**Lock (blocked / blocking)**

Terminal 1 — hold an exclusive lock:
```bash
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -c \
  "BEGIN; LOCK TABLE seed_target IN ACCESS EXCLUSIVE MODE; SELECT pg_sleep(60);"
```
Terminal 2 — issue a blocked query:
```bash
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -c "SELECT * FROM seed_target;"
```
Terminal 3 — run the TUI and verify section 2 shows the lock pair:
```bash
make run
```

**Idle in transaction (> 30s)**

Terminal 1 — open an interactive session and leave a transaction open:
```bash
docker compose exec -it postgres psql -U postgres
```
Inside psql:
```sql
BEGIN;
SELECT 1;
-- do not COMMIT or ROLLBACK — leave the session open
```
After 30 seconds, run the TUI and verify section 3 shows the idle session:
```bash
make run
```
